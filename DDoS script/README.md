# DDoS Attack Script üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview üåê

This script demonstrates a simple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using Python. It simulates overwhelming a target server by creating multiple simultaneous connections and sending HTTP requests.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This script is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script to attack networks, devices, or systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test on the target network or device.

What is a DDoS Attack? üåê
A DDoS attack involves multiple systems working together to send massive amounts of traffic to a single target. This flood of traffic overwhelms the target‚Äôs resources, causing it to slow down or become entirely unavailable to legitimate users.

Key Points:

Distributed: The attack is carried out by many computers (often compromised) working in unison, making it harder to stop.
Denial of Service: The goal is to deny legitimate users access to the targeted service by exhausting its resources.
Flooding: The attack typically floods the target with excessive data or requests, overwhelming its capacity.
Impact:

Service Disruption: Websites or online services become slow or completely unavailable.
Financial Loss: Affected businesses may experience loss of revenue and damage to their reputation.
Operational Disruption: Critical operations or communications can be halted.



## Prerequisites üìã

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of networking and sockets.
- A controlled, isolated environment for testing.

## Usage üöÄ

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the script file or clone the repository.

2. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/).

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

- Open the script file `main.py` in a text editor.
- **Set the `target` variable** to the IP address of your target.
- **Set the `port` variable** to the target port (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
- Optionally, change the `fake_ip` variable to another spoofed IP address.

### Running the Script ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Execute the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Additional Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Ethical Use**: Always ensure you have permission to run network tests and understand the potential impact.
- **Legal Implications**: Unauthorized use of DDoS attacks can lead to severe legal consequences.
- **Impact on Systems**: DDoS attacks can cause significant disruption to network services and systems. Use with caution in a controlled environment.
