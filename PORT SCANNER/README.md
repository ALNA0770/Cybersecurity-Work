# Port Scanning Script 🕵️‍♂️🔍

## Overview 🌐

This script performs a port scanning operation to identify open ports on a target IP address. By leveraging multi-threading, it efficiently scans a range of ports to determine which ones are open and available for connection.

> **⚠️ WARNING**: This script is intended for educational purposes and should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized scanning of networks and systems can be illegal and unethical.

## Features 🚀

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilizes multiple threads to speed up the scanning process.
- **Port Range**: Scans a range of ports from 1 to 1023, which are commonly used by various services.
- **Open Port Detection**: Identifies and lists open ports for further analysis.

## Prerequisites 📋

- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- **Permissions**: Obtain explicit permission to scan the target network or device.

## Usage 🛠️

1. **Setup**: 
   - Download or clone the script.
   - Open the script in a text editor.
   - Set the `target` variable to the IP address of the system you want to scan.

2. **Execution**:
   - Run the script using Python from the command line or terminal.

   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
   ```

3. **Results**:
   - The script will output open ports and list them at the end of the scan.

## Considerations ⚠️

- **Ethical Use**: Only use this script in controlled environments or on systems for which you have permission.
- **Impact**: Port scanning can be resource-intensive and might trigger security alerts on the target system.
